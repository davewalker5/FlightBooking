flight_booking
==============

A tutorial/demonstration project implementing a Python console application for creating and managing airline flight
bookings and passengers.

The project was inspired by an example in the "Core Python : Getting Started" PluralSight course by Austin Bingham
and Robert Smallshire and is intended as a practice project for the techniques contained in the PluralSight
"Core Python" path.

Structure
=========

+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Package**    | **Contents**                                                                                      |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| flight_booking | The core classes and business logic for the booking system                                        |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| booking_app    | A simple console application based on the functionality provided by the "flight_booking" package  |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| booking_web    | A simple Flask-based web site based on the functionality provided by the "flight_booking" package |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Running the Applications
========================

To run the applications, a virtual environment should be created, the requirements should be installed using pip and the
environment should be activated.

To run the console booking application, enter the following from the "src" folder:

::

    python -m booking_app

To run the web-based application in the Flask development web server, enter the following from the "src/booking_web"
folder:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/..
    export FLASK_APP=booking.py
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

The first three commands will need to be modified based on the current operating system. Once the development server
is running, browse to the following URL in a  web browser:

::

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Unit Tests and Coverage
=======================

To run the unit tests, a virtual environment should be created, the requirements should be installed using pip and the
environment should be activated.

The tests can then be run from the command line, at the root of the project folder, as follows:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src/
    python -m unittest

The first command adds the source folder, containing the two packages under test, to the PYTHONPATH environment
variable so the packages will be found when the tests attempt to import them. The command will need to be modified
based on the current operating system.

Similarly, a coverage report can be generated by running the following commands from the root of the project folder:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src/
    coverage run --branch --source src -m unittest discover
    coverage html -d cov_html

This will create a folder "cov_html" containing the coverage report in HTML format.

Generating Documentation
========================

To generate the documentation, a virtual environment should be created, the requirements should be installed
using pip and the environment should be activated.

HTML documentation can then be created by running the following command from the "docs" sub-folder:

::

    make html

The resulting documentation is written to the docs/build/html folder and can be viewed by opening "index.html" in a
web browser.

Dependencies
============

The flight booking application has dependencies listed in requirements.txt and also requires that one or more of the
boarding card generators are installed to enable generation and saving boarding cards.

Distribution
============

A distribution can be created that includes both the "flight_booking" and "booking_app" packages by running the
following from a command prompt at the root of the project:

::

    python setup.py bdist_wheel

Note that the project's virtual environment should **not** be activated when creating distributions.
