flight_booking
==============

A tutorial/demonstration project implementing a Python console application for creating and managing airline flight
bookings and passengers.

The project was inspired by an example in the "Core Python : Getting Started" PluralSight course by Austin Bingham
and Robert Smallshire and is intended as a practice project for the techniques contained in the PluralSight
"Core Python" path.

Structure
=========

The "flight_booking" package implements the classes and business logic for the booking system.

The "booking_app" package implement a simple console application based on the functionality provided by the
"flight_booking" package.

Unit Tests and Coverage
=======================

Unit tests can either be run in PyCharm or can be run from the command line, at the root of the project folder, as
follows:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src/
    python -m unittest

The first command adds the source folder, containing the two packages under test, to the PYTHONPATH environment
variable so the packages will be found when the tests attempt to import them. The command will need to be modified
based on the current operating system.

Similarly, a coverage report can be generated by running the following commands from the root of the project folder:

::

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src/
    coverage run --branch --source src -m unittest discover
    coverage html -d cov_html

This will create a folder "cov_html" containing the coverage report in HTML format.

Dependencies
============

The flight booking application has dependencies listed in requirements.txt and also requires that one or more of the
boarding card generators are installed to enable generation and saving boarding cards.

Distribution
============

A distribution can be created that includes both the "flight_booking" and "booking_app" packages by running the
following from a command prompt at the root of the project:

::

    python setup.py bdist_wheel
