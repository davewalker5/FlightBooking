flight_booking
==============
A tutorial/demonstration package implementing a Python package for creating and managing airline flight bookings and
passengers.

It was inspired by an example in the "Core Python : Getting Started" PluralSight course by Austin Bingham and Robert
Smallshire and is intended as a practice project for the techniques contained in the PluralSight "Core Python" path.

Example
-------
The "booking_app" package implements a simple text-based example that exercises the "flight_booking" package.

Unit Tests and Coverage
-----------------------

A coverage report can be generated by running the following command from the project folder:

::

    coverage run --branch --source src/tests -m unittest discover
    coverage html -d cov_html

This will  create a folder "cov_html" containing the coverage report in HTML format.

Dependencies
------------
The core flight booking package has no external dependencies but one or more of the boarding card generators are
required to generate and save boarding cards and they introduce their own dependencies. See the requirements.txt files
for the generator plugins for dependencies. Also, "coverage" should be installed to run the code coverage report.
