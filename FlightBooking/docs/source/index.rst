Airline Booking System Documentation
====================================

This project is a tutorial/demonstration project implementing a simplified system for creating and managing airline

It was inspired by an example in the “Core Python : Getting Started” PluralSight course by Austin Bingham and Robert
Smallshire and is intended as a practice project for the techniques contained in the PluralSight “Core Python” path.
